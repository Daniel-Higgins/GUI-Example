# GUI-Example
This program reads an excel file(us-5001.csv) and sorts the data into nodes based on Name, Location, and other attributes. The nodes are stored into an array[50] of linkedlists. The linkedlists are differentiated by state(NY, PA, NJ). Every node(person) in a linked list has the same state. The index each state-linkedlist has is predetermined by the index given in a hashmap(Map.java). The GUI lets the user select a state, then retrieves all nodes in that state-linkedlist. Following, the user selects a name and retrives all data about that node.
